A C++ translation of cartman300's C# text buffer for SFML.

To use the text buffer just create the class and call the Update() member in your renderloop (requires a reference to your sf::RenderWindow). Use the Print() member to output strings to your SFML window.

The class also requires you to load a font texture, one to use can be found at cartman300's GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/cartman300/SFMLTextBuffer">here</a>
